          About Me.
      </h1>
      <br><br><br>
      <p>  I am a dedicated research software engineer with comprehensive expertise in all phases of the software development life cycle. I like to think that I build computer programs that leverage algorithms and numerical methods to create highly efficient and effective computational models. I am committed to an iterative approach to software engineering, continuously refining and enhancing programs through successive milestones. I believe that sustained research and innovation is achieved through clearly defined goals and rigorous timelines.
