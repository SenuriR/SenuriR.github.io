      <h1 style="color: #8992AF">About Me.</h1> <br> 
      <section id="about">
      <p>
        I'm a research-focused software engineer with deep experience across the full software development life cycle. I’m passionate about bridging the fields of
        <strong>quantum mechanics</strong>, <strong>machine learning, artificial Intelligence</strong>, and <strong>nanotechnology</strong>. I approach software engineering as an
        iterative, goal-oriented process—continually refining systems through experimentation and milestone-driven development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I earned my <strong>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science</strong> from <strong>Rutgers University</strong> in May 2024. In Fall 2025, I’ll be pursuing a
        <strong>Master of Science in Quantum Science and Technology</strong> at <strong>Columbia University</strong>, where I plan to deepen my understanding of quantum systems while continuing to contribute to cutting-edge research.
      </p>

      <h2>Academic Background</h2>
      <p>
        As a computer science student with a strong interest in the life and physical sciences, I pursued a wide-ranging curriculum at Rutgers, including:
      </p>

        <li>Psychology</li>
        <li>Calculus I & II</li>
        <li>Statistics for Research</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Research & Professional Experience</h2>
      <p>
        Alongside coursework, I’ve gained extensive experience in academic research and software development, working on projects at the intersection of
        computational modeling, quantum theory, and scientific visualization.
        Visit the <a href="my_work.html">My Work</a> page for a detailed look at my projects and collaborations.
      </p>

      <h2>Currently</h2>
      <p>
        I’m actively seeking <strong>research assistant</strong> roles and <strong>computational software engineering</strong> opportunities that blend physics, CS,
        and data. I’m also preparing for my graduate studies in quantum science.
      </p>

      <h2>Beyond Tech</h2>
      <p>
        Outside of work and research, you’ll probably find me out on a long run (I recently completed my half-marathon training!), reading a good book, or hanging
        out with my dog.
