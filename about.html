          About Me
      </h1>
      <p> I am a dedicated software engineer with comprehensive expertise in all phases of the software development lifecycle. My passion lies in developing innovative applications that significantly impact society. I am committed to an iterative approach to software development, continuously refining and enhancing products through successive milestones. In a rapidly evolving technological landscape, I believe that sustained innovation is achieved through clearly defined goals and rigorous timelines. <br> <br>
      I am a recent graduate from Rutgers University. I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in May 2024. During my time at Rutgers, I took a wide range of courses in Computer Science and the Life and Physical Sciences. Here is a list of notable coursework (in chronological order of date taken): <br> <br>
