          About Me.
      </h1>
      <br><br><br>
      <p>  I am a dedicated research software engineer with comprehensive expertise in all phases of the software development life cycle. I like to think of myself as a determined computer scientist and software engineer interested in exploring the intersection of quantum computing, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and nanotechnology. I am committed to an iterative approach to software engineering, continuously refining and enhancing programs through successive milestones. I believe that sustained research and innovation is achieved through clearly defined goals and rigorous timelines.

      I am a recent graduate from Rutgers University. I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in May 2024. During my time at Rutgers, I took a wide range of courses. Here is a list of notable coursework (for a "computer science student with a massive interest in the life and physical sciences"!!): <br> <br>
        
        Computer Science Courses: <br> <br> 
        Introduction to Computer Science <br>
        Data Structures <br>
        Introduction to Linear Algebra <br>
        Computer Architecture <br>
        Introduction to Discrete Structures I <br>
        Introduction to Discrete Structures II <br>
        Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms <br>

        Chemistry Education <br>
        Psychology <br> <br>
        
        In addition to having taken a large variety of courses, I also gained significant experience in the academic research and software development setting. Please see the "My Work" page for an in-depth look at my experiences! <br> <br>       
        
        I am currently seeking full-time research assistant and computational modeling software engineer roles. I am also pursuing graduate school programs in Computer Science. <br> <br>
        
        In my free time I like to go on long runs (I recently completed my half-marathon training!!), play with my dog, or read a good book!
