          Sierpinksi Triangle
      </h1>
      <br>
      <p> LANGUAGE: JAVA</p>
      <p> COURSE: CS11 - INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER SCIENCE</p>
      <p> A Sierpinski triangle is a recursive structure of triangles within triangles. The order of the Sierpinski triangle refers to how many levels of nested triangles to draw.</p>
      <p> Process: There is one outer triangle that points upward. Then we can draw a downward facing triangle within it. This then creates three new upward facing triangles (above, left, and right of the downward one), in which we can repeat this process.</p>
      <p> This program take the order as a command-line argument (e.g., java Sierpinksi 2) and draws the corresponding Sierpinksi triangle </p>
      <p> I really appreciate this project because it was my first program where I used java AWT and Swing. This was very different from my previous experience of getting output on the command line terminal, it was more visual, and I really liked that. This allowed me to begin to see what other user interface implementations I could use in my code. Overall, this project was a very good introduction to Java AWT and Swing, and allowed me to make an integrated and involved recursion application to generate a Sierpinski Triangle. </p>
      <p> Here is my code: </p>
