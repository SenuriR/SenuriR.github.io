      <p> I've been going through LeetCode problems as a fun way to test my problem solving skills and prepare for interviews! I'll update this page if I come across a problem that was interesting or difficult to solve!</p>
      <p> LeetCode 15. 3Sum </p>
      <p> This problem was a little tricky for me because I couldn't figure out how to account for the possibility of duplicates. With the help of NeetCode, I realized that if you could sort the input array you could kind of make the solution something similar to the solution from Two Sum II, to make it more of a two pointer solution.</p>
      <p> I ended up with an O(n^2) time complexity solution. Here is my work trying to come up with a solution, followed by my submission:</p>
