          About Me
      </h1>
      <h2> <img src="ocean1.jpg" alt="sen" height="321" width="390"></h2>
      <p> I am a dedicated software engineer with comprehensive expertise in all phases of the software development lifecycle. My passion lies in developing innovative applications that significantly impact society. I am committed to an iterative approach to software development, continuously refining and enhancing products through successive milestones. In a rapidly evolving technological landscape, I believe that sustained innovation is achieved through clearly defined goals and rigorous timelines.</p>
      <p> I am a recent graduate from Rutgers University. I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in May 2024. During my time at Rutgers, I took a wide range of courses in Computer Science and the Life and Physical Sciences. Here is a list of notable coursework (in chronological order of date taken): <br> <br>
        
        Computer Science Courses: <br> <br> 
        Introduction to Computer Science <br>
        Data Structures <br>
        Introduction to Linear Algebra <br>
        Computer Architecture <br>
        Introduction to Discrete Structures I <br>
        Introduction to Discrete Structures II <br>
        Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms <br>
        Internet Technology <br>
        Machine Learning Principles <br>
        Linear Optimization <br>
        Software Methodology <br>
        Principles of Programming Languages <br>
        Introduction to Artificial Intelligence <br>
        Regression Methods <br> <br>

        Life and Physical Sciences Courses: <br> <br>
        Chemistry I and II <br>
        Biology I and II <br>
        Calculus I and II <br>
