          Welcome!
      </h1>
      <p> Hi there! My name is Senuri Rupasinghe, and welcome to my personal portfolio! To introduce myself, I am an undergraduate student at Rutgers University, New Brunswick. I am majoring in Computer Science (B.S.) and I hope to become a full-stack software engineer. I also intend on pursuing a PhD in either applied mathematics or machine learning and robotics after working as a software engineer. My goal is for this portfolio to be a place to show what I have learned, and what I hope to accomplish. </p>
