      <h1>
          Welcome!
      </h1>
      <p> Hi there! My name is Senuri Rupasinghe, and welcome to my personal portfolio! <br> <br>
          
          To introduce myself, I am a recent graduate from Rutgers University, New Brunswick. I received my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in May 2024. <br> <br>
          
          I am currently seeking full-stack software engineering roles. I also intend on pursuing a PhD in either Computer Science, Biological Physics, Mathematical Physics, or Artificial Intelligence after working as a software engineer. <br> <br>
          
          My goal is for this portfolio to be a place to show what I have learned, and what I hope to accomplish. </p>
