                Hi! I'm Sen :)
                <p> <img src="ocean1.jpg" alt="sen" height="321" width="390"></p>
                <p> I am a 4th year undergraduate student, majoring in Computer Science at Rutgers University New Brunswick.
                    Previously a pre-med, I recently discovered my passion for computer science and software engineering, so about a year ago I took the sharp decision to make the switch, and I think it was the best decision of my life.
                    I think with computer science, there is a lot of creativity involved with solving complex problems.
                    I like the freedom and raw creation that comes with writing code and solving problems.</p>
