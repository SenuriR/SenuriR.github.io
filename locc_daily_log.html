          LOCC Interactive Manim Project

      <p> Note: I've been working on this project since February 2024, but I've decided to start making daily logs starting July 7th 2024.</p>
      <p> 7/7/24: Today I’m trying to figure out why the full manim scene I wrote is not being rendered in the GUI.
        I believe this problem might be coming up because of resource limits, i.e., my environment has memory/CPU constraints that are impacting the execution of the program.
        To solve this bump, I am trying to implement the GUI in one thread, and the manim scene in another. Thankfully I learned about multi-threading in my Software Methodology (CS213) class this past semester, so this concept isn’t too daunting.
        After a bit of debugging and trying to figure out how video threads work specifically, I’ve been able to implement the thread logic correctly, but the SAME problem remains! Only 7 out of the (about) 51 animations of the manim scene are being generated.
        This is frustrating, but we were able to properly (I believe) implement the two threads, so that’s still a win because I think it’s a good thing to know how to do, and will probably be helpful down the road. Tomorrow will require some digging to find out what's going on.
