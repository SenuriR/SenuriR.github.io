        Writing.

      <br>
      <p> Hello! This is where I'll share some of my very random thoughts on a variety of topics, mainly centered around concepts in Computer Science and Mathematics.</p>
      <br><br><br>

      <h1 style="color: #8992AF"> On Engineering Culture </h1>
      <h2>October 2024</h2>
      <br>
      <p>There's a distinct feeling I get sometimes. It's the feeling I get after watching a YouTube video showcasing MIT Engineering. The feeling I get when I'm at a hackathon. The feeling that comes over me as I browse through someone's engineering portfolio—poorly designed, perhaps, but highly informative. This feeling is hard to put into words, but it all comes down to one thing: the culture of building in engineering. Tinkering with things. Breaking things. Forgetting about dinner because you're so immersed in your work. A focus so intense that time seems to slip away.</p>
      <p>I love this feeling, and I think it's part of what drew me to the field of computer science and software engineering. I love the idea of chasing that feeling. Of course, there are plenty of stressful elements in the field, but those moments of pure focus and the drive to build and create are truly wonderful.</p>

      <h1 style="color: #8992AF"> On Choosing a Field of Research.</h1>
      <h2>October 2024</h2>
      <br>
      <p>I feel like when you’re choosing something to research, something that you want to dig into, it has to be extremely specific. Only then can you experiment, break things, and arrive at extraordinary breakthroughs. But the key is that the idea you are researching is extremely specific. More on how this relates to my life soon...</p>

      <h1 style="color: #8992AF"> On Computational Science and Engineering.</h1>
      <h2>October 2024</h2>
      <br>
      <p>I think I was onto something about myself with my last entry! Since then, I've discovered the fields of computational science and modeling. I’ve come to realize that what excites me most about computer science is the ability to create computer programs that function as tools to model and solve problems related to physical and quantum systems. As I progress in my academic journey, I'm eager to make meaningful contributions to the fields of computational science and modeling by developing accurate models that enhance our understanding of a wide range of physical phenomena, from quantum mechanics to everyday systems.</p>

      <h1 style="color: #8992AF"> On Using Computer Science and Algorithms to Model Experiments.</h1>
      <h2>June 2024</h2>
      <br>
      <p>I just watched a video about CERN on Youtube. The video was created by Huge If True, and I found it to be very insightful. Essentially, they were trying to prove the existence of a subatomic particle, the Higgs Boson. They theorized that this mysterious particle should have existed in the moment the universe was created through the "Standard Model". The Standard Model is a beautiful piece of math by particle physicists. It essentially describes everything about what we are, in terms of math. But I digress. Through many decades of work and effort, the scientists at CERN actually recreated the Higgs Boson, and it was a massive jump in our understanding of the universe. The problem is, there were already BILLIONS of dollars put into the project to discover the Higgs Boson. To move onto more discoveries, an even larger testing site is required, meaning even more money is required. However, as a computer scientist, I wonder if there is a way to model exactly what they are doing, through pure math? Precise estimates, precise algorithms that can model this exact process. </p>
      <p>If I were to let my inner child come up with a solution, I would say, have a machine, say a "black box". You can play any material object into this machine, and then it would somehow take a full body scan of this object. After scanning, the machine would understand every single possible attribute of the object. Once these attributes are fully understood by the machine, then any possible experiment would, theoretically, be feasible to perform through a computational basis. This is because of the irrefutable fact that at the end of the day, every physical object in this universe can be boiled down to two things: math and physics. However, there is a major idea that must be accounted for in this machine: entropy. Disorder, randomness, etc. of the object must be accounted for… </p>
        <p>Now I don't think this idea is truly feasible with the existing technology of today. My idea requires a machine that is able to understand every single material, every single particle in existence. I don't know the specifics of this all, but I feel as though this might be very beneficial to future research. As I continue to work in research, I find this recurring thought at the forefront of my ideas… How could this experiment be perfectly simulated through a computer program. </p>
